# Vanguard Alpha Release - Setup Instructions!

Hello, data storage seekers! We are thrilled you are interested in storing your valuable data on our distributed, resilient, and durable decentralized cloud storage network. We want to thank you for joining the V3 waitlist and for your patience while we build this incredible network. 

We have been building up the available supply of storage capacity and bandwidth on the network for the last two months during the Explorer phase of our alpha.  The Vanguard release will welcome the first clients looking to store data to the network. This release is gated so we will be controlling how many invitations we send and each user will have disk space and egress bandwidth caps of 25 GB per month. We want to ensure you have a great experience during this alpha, and that the network grows at a sustainable pace. Your invitation to join the Vanguard alpha will give you early access to the V3 network to start integrating with our library and build applications with our V3 network as your storage layer. Since this is still an alpha please use extreme caution with the data you store on the network and make sure you have backups stored outside of the network. 

For this alpha release, we are not guaranteeing backward compatibility or any SLAs. 

### Before you begin
- Make sure you have received an email invitation to the Vanguard release. This email will contain a link to a Satellite with an authorization token in the URL, which you will use to create an account. As previously mentioned, the Vanguard alpha release is gated, so you may not receive an invitation right away at launch. 

### Creating your Satellite account and configuring your Uplink/S3 gateway:

1) Click on the link you received in the Vanguard invitation email. This will navigate you to the Mars Satellite account creation page where you can create your account. 

2) In the Satellite console, begin by creating a project. 

3) Create an API key for your project on the API Keys page. For each project, you can create multiple API keys but API keys do not work for multiple projects, just one. You will need at least 1 set of API keys in order to configure your Uplink or use our library. 

4) Set up your Uplink by following these instructions on GitHub: https://github.com/storj/docs/blob/master/Uplink-CLI.md

5) Set up your S3 gateway by following these  instructions on GitHub: https://github.com/storj/docs/blob/master/Explorer-Release-Setup-Instructions.md
